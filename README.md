# Data Warehousing Analysis of Noise Complaints

#### In this project, we wish to detect whether there is a correlation between temperature and 311 Complaints reported in New York City. We will analyze two different datasets: “311_Service_Requests_from_2010_to_Present” and “weather_data_5_boroughs_daily”, both of which are .csv files. It should be noted that the “weather_data_5_boroughs_daily” was given to us. The data in “311_Service_Requests_from_2010_to_Present” was filtered from NYC OpenData using the Socratica API.

## With the two datasets, we have mapped the following KPIs:

* Number of “Residential” Noise complaints per day/month
* Number of “Commercial” Noise complaints per day/month
* Number of Complaints per Complaint Type
* Average temperature per month
* Average temperature at location/borough
